## Introduction  
**Geometry Calculator** is a console-based Java application developed as part of the **ISB10103 - Principles of Computer Programming** course at **Universiti Kuala Lumpur (UniKL MIIT)** during the October 2023 session. The project was created under the guidance of:

- **Course Leader**: Ts. Tiliza Awang Mat  
- **Lecturers**: Ts. Nor Azlina Ali, Ms. Zailatul Syeema Mahadi, Dr. Suriana Sulong, Mr. Azrai Abdul Aziz  

The goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly tool to calculate the areas of 2D shapes and the volumes of 3D objects using core Java concepts such as object-oriented programming, arrays, and control structures.

## Problem Statements & Objectives

### Problem Statements
- **Manual Complexity**: Calculating geometric properties manually can be time-consuming and prone to error.
- **Fragmented Tools**: A lack of unified applications for both 2D and 3D calculations.
- **Learning Engagement**: Students benefit from hands-on Java projects that apply real-world programming techniques.

### Objectives
- Create a unified calculator for 2D areas and 3D volumes  
- Apply OOP principles including classes, objects, methods, and constructors  
- Utilize control structures (loops and conditionals) effectively  
- Provide a menu-based, user-friendly console interface

## Program Scope  
The Geometry Calculator allows users to:
- **Calculate Areas** of:
  - Circle
  - Rectangle
  - Triangle
- **Calculate Volumes** of:
  - Cylinder
  - Sphere
  - Cone
  - Pyramid

Users can input multiple shapes in one session. The application is written in **Java** and run through the **command line**, utilizing **arrays**, **methods**, and **Scanner** for input handling.
